# ETL with Wiki and Kaggle Movie Data

## Overview of Project
Data is awesome! And there is so much of it out there to analyze. There is a great amount of exploration into truth that can be accomplished through data science. But in order to get to that truth, the raw data first has to be organized so that it can actually be read. Data comes from a plethora of sources. Depending on the industry and the project, data harvested for research can be either relatively clean or pretty dirty. Extract, transform, and load (ETL) is the process by which data scientists harvest data, clean it up to be presentable, and then load it into databases for wide-spread use. ETL is the goal of module 8 of the DU Data Analytics bootcamp.

### Purpose of Project
The specific purpose of this week's module is to harvest data associated with movies in an effort to determine if through data science, an accurate understanding can be obtained about what really makes movies widely popular. If we can understand what makes movies popular, we can also build an algorithm that might give a hint as to what movies might grow in popularity in the future. In this module a psuedo-company is seeking to purchase low-cost streaming rights for movies that will eventually become household favorites. Nothing like a little financial margin to motivate the data scientists!

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
This module had a lot of information in it: learning the ETL process, gaining an understanding of regular expressions (regex), migrating data into Python (Pandas) and then out into a SQL database.
